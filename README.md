# Stats viewing app

Create a basic stats viewing application by designing a database schema,
importing data from a CSV file and implementing the routes.

## Installation

This project comes with a pre-seeded SQLite database. Run `php artisan serve` to
start a web server.

Make sure to run the migrations and seeders and update the configuration if you
would like to run this application with a MySQL database.

## Assignment

In the `storage/` folder you will find two files: _stats_2024_03_31.csv_ and
_stats_2024_04_01.csv_.

These files contain individual monetization events with or without tracking
parameters: utm_campaign and utm_term.

First, extend the database schema in a way that lets you store these stats in a
format which allows you run hourly breakdowns by utm_campaign and utm_campaign +
utm_term. Stats should link to the campaigns table.

The schema should be as normalized as possible, preferably 3rd normal form.
utm_campaign and utm_term values should exist only once in the whole database.

Second, implement the `ImportStatsCommand`. It should accept a filename and import
the data from that file into the newly created schema. A row should not be
imported when it does not have a value for the utm_campaign or utm_term column.

Finally, implement the routes defined in `routes/web.php`. The first route
should render a table with all revenue aggregated by campaign. Each row should
link to the second route.

The second route should render a table with all revenue for a single campaign
broken down by date and hour.

The third route should render a table with all revenue for a single campaign
broken down by utm_term.
